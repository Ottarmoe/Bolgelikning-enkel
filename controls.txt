You can move around by right-click dragging the window, 
and zooming with the schroll wheel

You can also move with WASD+X+C+LSHIFT+LCTRL. LSHIFT/LCTRL zooms in/out. 
C/X doubles/halves the speed of motion

Left-click dragging a subwindow will move it

Be aware that while no limits are imposed on the controls, 
going unreasonably far will have unintended consequences
