Good luck running this on anything but Windows

You can move around by right-click dragging the window, 
and zooming with the schroll wheel

The string window can be controlled by click and dragging over the string

You can also move with WASD+X+C+LSHIFT+LCTRL. LSHIFT/LCTRL zooms in/out. 
C/X doubles/halves the speed of motion

A pineable subwindow will have a dot in its top left corner
clicking it will swap the window between move/scaleable, and static

Be aware that while no limits are imposed on the controls, 
going unreasonably far will have unintended consequences
